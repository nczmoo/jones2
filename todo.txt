add gameloop basics


XXX convert 3 goodwill type to 1 othertype
XXX convert goodwill to work reputation
XXX work reputation nets you a promotion (1-10%)
XXXX earn money at the end of the week
XXXX having 0 - 10 rep is a fail
+++ neg is the new condition
XXX the penalty becomes less with  numOfDays as part of the variable 
+++ changed the upper range to not be bound by that
XXX more than 16 hours per day becomes unwieldy
+++ capped at 16 hours
XXX each type should have a thing / what incentive is there to be able to put more hours towards categories
+++ the promotion aspect and different hours required and everything else 
XXXX What if the dayNum modifier for the upper range of this.config.gain was specific  to each category and is halved each time you don't put anything towards it?
XXX change convert from 3:1 to 1:1 or 2:1 because it seems like every situation 3 would always be worth more 



XXX add reqHours next to unassignedHours
XXXX if you have 3 stars, bold them
XXX add stars to promotion page
XXX change convert button to star star -> star
XXX disabled link to office politics when you can't do it
XXXX round wage and upgraded wage in promotion page
XXX round percerntages on promotion buttons
XXX randomize between 9, 16 for reqHours AND console.log it to keep track of the seq
XXX show percent of raise in () after raisedWage
XXX no category should ever have more than 8 (this should have been obvious)
XXXX press ! button to reset to 0 if max or > reqHours BUT change color to reflect its change in behavior
XXX check convert that from is different from to
XXX when selecting convertFrom, remove the convertFrom from convertTo
XXXX refactor



remove reqhours because its confusing if you don't understand wahts going on
run it through 9-16 THEN randomly generate it
lower upper range of rand generation of reqHours when player fails and increasing it when they don't
stars aren't showing up properly
check if the fail penalty is being implemented properly because I put 1 
	in a category but it still went up to 99 the next day
generate new raise when promoted
have deltaRep initially be populated with the rep if empty AND if you fulfill the req


MAYBE 
type 'resets after every promotion and on monday' on promotion page



CONCERNS
While it feels difficult at 16, I'm wondering if it should occassionally go above this, 
	because I'm not dying and its starting to feel rote.
it feels bad when you have excess that cannot be efficiently allocated somewhere
another argument FOR getting the reqHour GAIN as part of adding each hour is so they 
	don't automatically have to just add 1 automatically and could be incentivized to possibly add more

NEW
add interns or employees
add overtime or doubletime
add buying stuff with money


NO
should the 100% gain be per hour instead of at 100%? this would resolve the next concern
--- this creates the hard choices. TRY IT though duriing 100 h development to see how it changes the game
